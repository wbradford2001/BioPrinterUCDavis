# BioPrinterUCDavis
3D BioPrinter Marlin Configuration UC Davis

# Overview
upload file "CONFIGURED_OCT_25" to arduino to control a bioprinter that aims to be able to print transgenic protein in a cellular matrix. 

# Instructions
If you are part of the BioPrinter Electric Team, for all intents and purposes, "configuration.h" and maybe "configuration_adv.h" are all that we care about. In these files we edit and input the parameters of the printer(width, height, ect...) that tell the arduio how to move, how much to extrude, ect..


# Task List
- Need to configure the kinematics of the x,y, and z motors to match the Bio Team's print specifications.
- Need to configure the extruder motor to extrude whatever amount per second the Bio Team specifies.
